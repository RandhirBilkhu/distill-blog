In part 1 I used a Jupyter notebook to perform step by step calculations in order to generate a YLT. I feel that Jupyter notebooks/R scripts are useful for ad-hoc analysis and getting to an answer quickly. However I don't think they are the best for making code ready for production. 

In this post, I want to take that code and make it much easier to re-use in the future. I will do this by wrapping up the bulk of the steps inside two classes and putting them into modules

Before I start I will define some of the terminology.

Classes allow objects to be created, effectively a blueprint for how an object should look and behave. Each object can have attributes and methods which can be utilised. Methods are like functions that belong to the object.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.


#### Creating the classes

I decided to start by creating a class Elt (see below). I am going to use this class to return a parameterised ELT from a raw elt dataframe.

Firstly I start by creating a function called `__init__` . "__init__" is a reseved method in python classes. It is known as a constructor in object oriented concepts. This method called when an object is created from the class and it allow the class to initialize the attributes of a class.

Note that inside `__init__` I have two arguments, self and pandas_obj. self is a reference to the current instance of the class (note you dont have to use the word 'self' but it is the convention). The second is pandas_obj which refers to the raw elt dataframe which will be used in each instance of the class.

Secondly, I define a validate method which will raise an error if the required columns are not in the dataframe.The main method for this class is the function parameterise  - inside this function I put all of the calculations to generate the parameterised elt. Please see part 1 for more detail on these.

At the end, I also define a property which is the sum of event frequency.

```{python, echo=TRUE}
class Elt:
    
    def __init__(self,pandas_obj):
        self.df = pandas_obj
        self._validate(pandas_obj)
    
    @staticmethod
    def _validate(obj):
        # verify the minumum required columns are present in the intial dataframe
        if 'id' not in obj.columns or 'rate' not in obj.columns or 'mean' not in obj.columns or 'sdevi' not in obj.columns or 'sdevc' not in obj.columns or 'exp' not in obj.columns:
            raise AttributeError("dataframe must have id, rate, mean, sdevi, sdevc and exp columns")

    def parameterise(self):
        self.df['mdr'] = self.df['mean']  /self.df['exp']   # calculates the mean damage ratio equivalent to average loss over total exposed
        self.df['sdev'] = self.df['sdevi'] + self.df['sdevc'] # sums up the correlated and independent standard deviations 
        self.df['cov'] = self.df['sdev'] /self.df['mean'] # calculates covariance based on total standard deviation
        self.df['alpha'] = (1 - self.df['mdr']) / (self.df['cov']**2 - self.df['mdr']) # generates an alpha parameter for beta distribution
        #alpha is finite <-0 TODO
        self.df['beta'] = (self.df['alpha'] * (1 - self.df['mdr'])) / self.df['mdr']  # generates a beta parameter for beta distribution
        self.df['rand_num'] = self.df['rate'] / self.df['rate'].sum()  # probability of event occuring = normalised event frequency 
        self.df.index += 1 ### want to set index to start from 1 ( so sampling works)

    @property
    def events(self):
        total = self.df['rate'].sum()
    
```


Now I can write a class for everything needed for the YLT:

```{python, echo=TRUE}
import numpy as np

class Ylt:
    """
    generates YLT
    """
    seed = np.random.seed(42)
    
    def __init__(self,pandas_obj):
        self.df = pandas_obj

    def generate_ylt(self, sims=10):

        num_events = np.random.poisson(self.df['rate'].sum(), sims) 

        sample_ids = np.random.choice( a = self.df['id'] , size = num_events.sum() , replace= True, p = self.df['rand_num'] ) 
        self.df = self.df[['id', 'alpha','beta','exp']].iloc[self.df.index.get_indexer(sample_ids)] ### this took some effort! 
        self.df['severity_mdr'] = self.df.apply( lambda x: np.random.beta( x['alpha'] , x['beta']  ) , axis=1 ) ### use apply with axis =1 to use function on each row
        self.df['severity'] = self.df['severity_mdr'] * self.df['exp'] ### this gives us severity for each event

        year = np.arange(1, sims + 1, 1) # start (included): 0, stop (excluded): 10, step:1
        all_years = pd.DataFrame(year , columns=['year'])

        self.df['year'] = np.repeat(year, num_events)
        self.df = self.df[['year', 'severity']]
        self.df = pd.merge(self.df, all_years, how='right').fillna(0)

    def oep(self):
        
        rp = pd.DataFrame([10000,5000,1000,500,250,200,100,50, 25,10,5,2], columns=['return_period'])
        rp['ntile'] = 1 - 1 / rp['return_period'] 
        return(self.df.groupby(['year'])['severity'].max().quantile(rp['ntile']))

```


Firstly I use numpy to set the random seed so that results are reproducible. (Note - would it make a difference inside the init function?)

Next, I define a method generate_ylt which performs the simulation steps in part1 and returns the YLT containing a column with year and column with the loss amount.

Lastly I define a method to calculate oep. For the purposes of this exercise I fixed the calculation of OEP at the specified return periods, but I could have passed an additional argument `rp` along with self to allow the return periods to be variable.

#### Containg the modules inside a package

I can define these two classes as modules as elt.py and ylt.py and contain them in a package called elt_py. In order to read the folder as a package an empty .py file with `__init__.py` is also needed at the folder level.

There are a few other things to take care of in order to distribute the code as a package but they are outside the scope of this post.

Once I have create the package, I can import the classes from the elt_py package and the process generate a YLT is much simplified. I can generate the oep with just 8 lines of code and the ability to instantiate different instances of ELTs and YLTs make it easy to apply these classes to different ELTs

```python
from elt_py.elt import Elt
from elt_py.ylt import Ylt

import pandas as pd

X = pd.read_csv("example.csv")

elt = Elt(X)
elt.parameterise()
ylt = Ylt(elt.df)
ylt.generate_ylt(sims=2000)

print(ylt.oep())

```

#### Summary

Creating classes and containing code in modules requires a good deal of extra work over writing an ad-hoc script. However by writing a class and housing the code into modules ( and a package), it makes it much easier to re-use and distribute the code.

One of the other major benefits would be the ability to incorporate unit testing on the methods being created which I will cover in a future post in detail.
