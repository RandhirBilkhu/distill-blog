  My personal blog about R, Python and data science

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I hope to use this blog as a tool for self learning and documentation as I try to expand my skills and knowledge of data science.

I'm sure there will be many ways I can improve upon what I post here, and I would really welcome any feedback or suggestions.
